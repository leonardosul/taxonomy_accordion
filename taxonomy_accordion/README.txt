This module provides a block for each taxonomy vocabulary set up in your site.
The block consists of a H3 tag containing the top level taxonomy term
for each specific vocabulary, and a list of links to the sub terms, if any
exist. There is also a link to a page that lists all pages that are aassociated
with the top level term. Initially the links are hidden, and are shown by
clicking on the H3 heading.
